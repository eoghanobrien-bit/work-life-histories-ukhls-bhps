# Work Life Histories in the UKHLS and BHPS
This is the repository where I keep the latest version of the code I have written to construct work-life histories for participants in the UKHLS and BHPS. This code will be added to the UK Data Service in due course.

Work-life histories for BHPS participants specifically has been constructed previously by Brendan Halpin, Gillian Paull, and David Mar√©. Please see the Working Paper in this repository for specifically references.

If you notice errors in the code, inadequate explanation/documentation, or would like features adding, please open an issue and I will try to respond. If you have other questions, you can email me at: liam.wright@ucl.ac.uk

Thanks,

Liam
