# Work Life Histories in the UKHLS and BHPS
This is the repository where I keep the latest version of the code I have written to construct work-life histories for participants in the UKHLS and BHPS. Download this repository and see the [report on the Open Science Foundation](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/C3V9F) on using this code. The code will hopefully be added to the UK Data Service at some point.

Work-life histories for BHPS participants specifically has been constructed previously by Brendan Halpin, Gillian Paull, and David Mar√©. Please see the report in this repository for specifically references.

If you notice errors in the code, inadequate explanation/documentation, or would like features adding, please open an issue and I will try to respond.

If you do use the code, please cite it (the OSF project has a [doi](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/C3V9F)), and more importantly, share your own code!

Thanks,

Liam
